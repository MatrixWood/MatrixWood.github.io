                            <p><small>March 12, 2020</small></p>
                            
                              <p>In preparation for a talk at <a href="https://nescala.io/">NEScala</a> I wrote this quick survey on the research on curriculum and pedagogy for teaching programming (curriculum means what we teach, and pedagogy is how we teach it). My goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>give a framework for thinking about curriculum and pedagogy;</li>
<li>give some specific tips for teaching programming;</li>
<li>point out where I believe more research is needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>My survey is based on the published literature, but it’s not a comprehensive document. I’m not an academic and I don’t have the time (sadly) to read all the relevant literature. However I’ve linked to papers I found interesting or important so you can explore further if something grabs your interest. There is a lot of interesting research out there and the tiny bit I’ve read has made my teaching much better.</p>

                              <p>In a <a href="./posts/2020-02-06-serverless-scala-services.html">previous</a> post I discussed the steps needed to compile a <a href="https://http4s.org/">http4s</a> web service to an executable with <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/native-image/">GraalVM Native Image.</a>. It’s natural to ask what tradeoffs are made by going this route instead of using the JVM. In this post I present several benchmark results I obtained comparing the Native Image executable to the running on the JVM. Read on to find out which comes out on top!</p>

                              <p>A recent project has involved serverless web services in Scala, which led me to investigate using GraalVM’s Native Image tool to create native executables. In this blog post I describe the steps necessary to build a native executable from a simple <a href="https://http4s.org/">http4s</a> web service. There is also <a href="https://github.com/inner-product/http4s-native-image">complete code</a> accompanying this example.</p>

                              <p>A few weeks ago we wrapped up season two of <a href="https://www.scalabridgelondon.org/">ScalaBridge London</a>. (For us, a “season” is an intensive series of meetings over a short period of time. Season two was six meetings in six weeks, but we might change this in future.) Here I want to reflect on what—in my opinion—were the good and bad parts of this season, and discuss what happens next.</p>

                              <p>I would like to measure the effectiveness of <a href="https://www.scalabridgelondon.org/">ScalaBridge London</a>, but this raises some tricky questions. For example, what does it even mean for ScalaBridge to be effective? I’m not sure. I’m writing this largely as a way to organise my thoughts, and share with others who may be able to help.</p>
