        <p><a href="http://www.scaladays.org/">Scala Days 2014</a> wrapped up last week. There were many great talks and great conversations. Here I want to highlight some of the … well … highlights of the three hectic days the five of us spent in Berlin.</p>
<p>My favourite talk at Scala Days was <a href="https://twitter.com/runarorama">Runar’s</a> on the value of <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4588997/ReasonablyPriced.pdf">free monads</a>. The aim of the talk was to show how monads can be combined more easily than allowed by <a href="http://underscoreconsulting.com/blog/posts/2013/12/20/scalaz-monad-transformers.html">monad transformers</a> by using the <a href="http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/Free+Monad.html">free monad</a> and some implicit magic. The concept of free functors (free monoids, free monads, and so on) is quite simple but powerful. I hope to blog more about it in the future. For now, go read <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4588997/ReasonablyPriced.pdf">Runar’s slides</a>.</p>
<p>I didn’t attend <a href="http://scalamacros.org/paperstalks/2014-06-17-EasyMetaprogrammingForEveryone.pdf">Easy Metaprogramming For Everyone!</a> but Dave tells me it was a fantastic talk. The summary is that a new API for macros is in development. This new API is much simpler to use – for instance, separate compilation will no longer be necessary – and enables better IDE support.</p>
<p>I did attend Dave’s <a href="https://github.com/underscoreio/essential-macros">talk on macros</a> and I found it an excellent introduction. I’d never written a Scala macro before Dave’s talk, but following it I immediately opened my laptop and knocked out a macro I’ve wanted to write for a long time (for logging the current file and line). Check it out if, like me, you’re new to macros and want an easy introduction.</p>
<p>Another talk I enjoyed was <a href="http://jmhofer.johoop.de/?p=548">Enterprise Brownfield: Scala to rescue</a>. The main point I took from it is that one great developer can bulldoze through any obstacles. Some believe that process can substitute for ability, but I don’t hold with this. Not everybody on the team needs to be awesome, but having at least one very good developer makes a huge difference in my experience.</p>
<p>Of course all of this pales next to the consensus talk of the conference, Scala: The First Ten Years. Go read <a href="http://rapture.io/tenyears/">the slides</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-DXJT8VnAA">watch the trailer</a>, and then weep that you, like I, missed it.</p>
<p>I could write a lot more about other talks I saw, but it would make for a very long blog post. Kevin Wright is <a href="https://gist.github.com/kevinwright/9505828a0dcc0c4c0d56">collecting slides</a> from Scala Days so check out that link for any talks on which you want more detail.</p>
<p>Conferences are good on many levels, which is why we’re very happy to be helping organise London’s <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/1948-scala-exchange-2014">Scala Exchange</a> in December. The Call for Papers has just opened, and you can expect more announcements soon.</p>
