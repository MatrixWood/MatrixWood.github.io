        <p>How will machine learning change how we interact with computers? This a question I attempted to <a href="../downloads/cw-future-tech-2013.pdf">answer</a> at <a href="http://www.cambridgewireless.co.uk/crmapp/EventResource.aspx?objid=45060">the inaugural CW Future Tech meeting</a>. The talk was given th <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha">Pecha Kucha</a> style, so the slides don’t stand up well on their own. Let me sketch the argument here.</p>
<p>The typical outcome of software development is a complex machine designed for a human to operate. It has lots of buttons to press, and maybe even some sliders and levers to pull. These machines amplify what a human can achieve, but the job of operating them is not much different from that which an assembly line worker performs.</p>
<p>With machine learning we can delegate more work to the machine. We give the machine a high level goal and gets on with the job, with minimal intervention. Domestic robots like the <a href="http://www.irobot.com/global/en/">Roomba</a> are an obvious example of this, but I think the real revolution will occur in the data centre. I see <a href="http://mynaweb.com/">Myna</a> as an early step on the road to marketing automation, and <a href="http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/en/assets/1/event/101/Beyond%20Pretty%20Charts%E2%80%A6_%20Analytics%20for%20the%20cloud%20infrastructure%20Presentation.pdf">anomaly detection</a> as a step towards devops automation.</p>
<p>That’s the gist of it. There isn’t much you can say in 6 minutes and 40 seconds, but take a look at <a href="../downloads/cw-future-tech-2013.pdf">the slides</a> for a bit more colour.</p>
<p>This was the first time I’ve done a presentation in the Pecha Kucha style. It was way harder than any other talk I’ve given! Sticking to the strict timing required a lot of practice and it was difficult to balance the content so I had a roughly equal amount to say for each slide. I ended up chasing the slides a bit towards the end of my talk, which is probably better than having pauses to fill. I ended up being the only presenter who had the 20s-per-slide time limit enforced – my slides were in PDF, while everyone else was using Powerpoint. I think they had a much easier time of it!</p>
